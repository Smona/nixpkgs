#+title: Smona's Home Configuration

* Installation
1. Clone this repository into ~$HOME/.config~.
2. ~cp settings.template.nix settings.nix~
3. Update ~settings.nix~ to reflect the machine you're installing on.
4. ~./install.sh~.

Have fun!

** Recommended manual steps
*** Set up 1password
1password has to be installed at the system level to support the browser
integration, system authentication, and the SSH agent. On NixOS it will already
be installed, but otherwise go ahead and install it from your operating system's
package manager.

After installing, log in to 1password. 1password settings are managed, so the
SSH agent and system authentication will be automatically enabled.

*** Set up syncthing shared folders
home-manager will install syncthing and enable its systemd service on machines
that use it.

Ensure syncthing is started, then go to [[http://localhost:8384][http://localhost:8384]] to add a GUI
password, link it to remote devices, and set up shared folders (such as ~/org in
my case). Who needs dropbox?

* Local Configuration
Several tools are set up to include local configuration files, to allow
overriding the reproducible configuration with arbitrary machine-specific
options.

- ~$HOME/.zsh.local~
- ~$HOME/.gitconfig.local~

I may one day decide to do this in a nix-ey way, but this is how my old
configuration worked, and it's a good setup.

* Backlog
** TODO note about previous repo for finding git history
** TODO refresh doom env on startup or disable
It leads to time wasted debugging problems caused by the environment not being
up to date when rapidly iterating on nix stuff.

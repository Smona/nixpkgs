* Installation
*WARNING:* The install script will delete your existing dotfiles if they would
conflict with the installation process. Make sure to backup those dotfiles
before installing.

1. Clone this repository into ~~/.config~.
2. ~.cd ~~/.config/nixpkgs && ./install.sh~.

Have fun!

* Local Configuration
Several tools are set up to include local configuration files, to allow
overriding the reproducible configuration with arbitrary machine-specific
options.

- ~~/.zsh.local~
- ~~/.gitconfig.local~

I may one day decide to do this in a nix-ey way, but this is how my old
configuration worked, and it's a good setup.

* Backlog
** TODO note about previous repo for finding git history
** TODO refresh doom env on startup or disable
It leads to time wasted debugging problems caused by the environment not being
up to date when rapidly iterating on nix stuff.
